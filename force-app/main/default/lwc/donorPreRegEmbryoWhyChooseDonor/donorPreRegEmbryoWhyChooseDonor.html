                        Donor 21 isn‚Äôt just a system‚Äîit‚Äôs a commitment to the children created through donation, and to the families who love them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We sat down with hundreds of donor-conceived individuals and their families to understand their real needs‚Äîmedical, emotional, and personal. Every feature we offer was shaped by what they told us they wish they had.

                    <p>
                        Our health intake isn‚Äôt just a form‚Äîit‚Äôs a 75-minute, medically-informed questionnaire based on techniques taught at institutions like Yale, Harvard, and Duke. These are the same principles used to train doctors to gather meaningful, reliable medical history.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Every submission is individually reviewed by trained professionals‚Äînot to provide medical advice, but to ensure completeness. Unlike casual updates or conversations, our process captures the full picture‚Äîso your child has what they need when it matters most.

                        Up to 80% of diagnoses in medicine can be made from health history alone.*
                        <br/><br/>
                        That‚Äôs why we take it seriously‚Äîand why your child‚Äôs future deserves more than a checkbox form.

                    <p>
                        Research shows that donor-conceived individuals who are denied access to their origins face increased risks of depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety‚Äîespecially when identity information is withheld or discovered later in life without support.
                        <br/><br/>
                        At Donor 21, we believe access to identity and medical history isn‚Äôt just ethical‚Äîit‚Äôs protective. Our platform provides meaningful updates and connection options, while respecting the boundaries and consent of everyone involved.
